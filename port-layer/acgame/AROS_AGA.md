# ACGame Amiga backend (AmigaOS 3.x and AROS m68k)

One backend, `src/platform_aros_aga.c`, builds for AmigaOS 3.x with the
`os32-gcc16` stove (GCC 16.2 with the Team's fixes, libnix, the OpenGPU SDK
0.7: `make -f Makefile.amigaos STOVE=...`) and for AROS m68k with the AROS
toolchain. It needs only the operating system, so it runs on a real Amiga with
no OpenGPU and no OpenInput; on AmigaChrome the same program hands its work to
the cores and the GPU where the system offers it.

## Display

- Intuition opens an 8-bit custom screen. `acgame_video_config.display` picks
  the kind: `AUTO` (the system's best 8-bit mode, an RTG one where one exists),
  `AGA` (the native chipset's default mode) or `RTG`. The variable
  `ENV:ACGame/Display` (`AGA`, `RTG` or `AUTO`) overrides what the game asked for.
- The game renders an 8-bit chunky frame in normal (Fast) memory.
- On a planar 8-plane screen (native AGA) `acgame_c2p8_fast` converts the frame
  into the screen's planes: an 8x8 bit transpose in 32-bit registers, about 30
  instructions for eight pixels where the reference converter takes 64 tests.
  OpenGfx has no planar path for `WriteChunkyPixels` yet, so this stays
  ACGame's own work on every machine.
- On any other 8-bit screen (OpenRTG, or another RTG system) the frame goes
  through graphics.library's `WriteChunkyPixels` (V40, OS 3.1 and later).
  OpenGfx (opengpu.library 0.8 and later) owns that call, so on AmigaChrome the
  copy into the board is done by the cores; on a real Amiga with Picasso96 it is
  the RTG system's own code. `acgame_platform_get_info()` says which.
- `LoadRGB32` updates the 256-colour palette only when it changes.
- `WaitTOF` is the presentation boundary.

## Input

- A borderless backdrop window supplies keyboard, mouse buttons and relative
  mouse movement.
- Pads come through **OpenInput** (openinput.library 1.2 or later) when it is
  there: hot-plug, analogue sticks and triggers, every pad in SDL 2's
  GameController layout. ACGame takes one pad, a plugged-in one (USB, or a pad
  on AmigaChrome's cores) before the Amiga's own joystick port, and opens it
  with `OIT_Exclusive` while the game runs, so the pad stops driving its Amiga
  port for older programs until the game closes. When the pad goes, the next
  one that comes is taken.
- When openinput.library is missing, or is the 1.1 skeleton, or
  `ENV:ACGame/OpenInput` is `0`, a joystick or CD32 pad in port 2 comes through
  lowlevel.library's `ReadJoyPort`, as before.
- `acgame_input_state.pad` has the pad in full (buttons as
  `ACGAME_PAD_BIT(ACGAME_PAD_A)` and so on, the six axes, where it came from
  and its name). The d-pad or left stick, A, B, X and Start are also ORed into
  the keyboard's `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `FIRE1`, `FIRE2`, `FIRE3` and
  `START`, so a game that reads only `key[]` gets the pad too.
- OpenInput's frozen header is copied unchanged into
  `include/acgame/openinput/` (from openamigainput `include/`), so ACGame
  builds with nothing else installed. The library bases have ACGame's own
  names (`acgame_LowLevelBase`, `acgame_OpenInputBase`, `acgame_OpenGPUBase`),
  so a game that also links SDL 2 has no clash.

## Threads

ACGame has no threads of its own. Everything it does runs on the game's task,
so there is nothing to move to OpenMulticore under the Team's Threading Rule.

## Programs

- `acgame-aga-smoke`, `acgame-rtg-smoke`, `acgame-smoke` (`examples/aga_smoke.c`,
  AGA, RTG or the system's pick): `[AGA|RTG|AUTO] [FRAMES]`. Animates a 320x200
  checker, says which screen and which path it got, and how many frames a second.
- `acgame-joy` (`examples/joy_test.c`): `[AGA|RTG|AUTO] [FRAMES]`. A lamp for
  each standard button, the two sticks and the two triggers; the top strip is
  green for OpenInput, yellow for lowlevel.library, red for no pad. Changes are
  printed too.

Escape quits each of them.

## Building

```sh
make -f Makefile.amigaos STOVE=~/AmigaChrome/stoves/os32-gcc16/prefix
sh tests/run_tests.sh          # the converters and HAM8 encoder on the host
```

The build is `-Wall -Wextra -Werror -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks` and must
stay clean; it also builds with the older `os32` (GCC 6.5) stove. AROS builds
the same three source files with `-I include` and nothing else (the game ports'
`scripts/build_game_ports_job.py`).

## Current limitations

- direct write into the displayed BitMap rather than ScreenBuffer double
  buffering;
- PCM audio and HAM8 presentation are still stubs.
